OpenSSL FIPS provider.

QuicTLS Releases

None yet :)

Currrent Changes
----------------
- Based on OpenSSL 3.3, with some code from OpenSSL 3.4 cherry-picked.

- Remove support for some old configuration options:
  - unit-test as there was only one, so not worth the complication
  - fips, no-fips since we do not build a FIPS-validated container
  - ecdh, it was a no-op
  - no-dgram is now implied by no-sock (no longer can turn off just UDP)
  - nextprotoneg (disabled by default) has been removed; it was replaced
by the ALPN extension, IETF RFC 7301, in 2014.

- Remove support for EGD random source.

- Made the `ERR_STACK` datatype opaque.

- The undocumented function `X509_OBJECT_up_ref_count` has been
made private.

- Remove some depecrated (3.0) undocumented functions that were just
aliases for others: `BUF_strdup`, `BUF_strndup`, `BUF_memdup`,
`BUF_strlcpy`, `BUF_strlcat`, and `BUF_strnlen`.

- All support for SRP has been removed.

- Removed some functions deprecated in the OpenSSL 1.1.0 release:
`ENGINE_setup_bsd_cryptodev`,
`PKCS12_get_attr`, and `SSL_set_debug`.

- Removed most of the deprecated functions from OpenSSL 0.9.8, but keep
`BN_is_prime_fasttest`, `CRYPTO_mem_ctrl`, `DH_generate_parameters`, and
`RSA_generate_key` for compatibility with outside applications.

- Removed support for some old platforms:
  - Removed support for old HPE platforms: NonStop and Tandem
  - Removed DJGPP support.
  - Removed WinCE support.
  - Removed IRIX support.
  - Removed HP-PARISC (including MPE/ix) support.
  - Removed `I386_only` support.
  - Removed support for SCO platforms.
  - Removed support for Apollo.
  - OSF/1, True64, and Ultrix support.
  - Remove Itanium (IA-64) support.
  - Removed OSF/1, True64, and Ultrix support.
  - VMS, OpenVMS, etc., on all hardware.

- Simplified `util/shlib_wrap`; if your shell doesn't do "$@" properly
when there are no arguments, please look at an earlier version.

- Cherry-picked changes to assembly generation to support running code
in execute-only mode and with indirect branch tracking on modern intel
hardware.
