=head1 NAME

openssl-env - OpenSSL environment variables

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The OpenSSL libraries use environment variables to override the
compiled-in default paths for various data.
To avoid security risks, the environment is usually not consulted when
the executable is set-user-ID or set-group-ID.

=over 4

=item B<CTLOG_FILE>

Specifies the path to a certificate transparency log list.
See L<CTLOG_STORE_new(3)>.

=item B<HTTPS_PROXY>, B<HTTP_PROXY>, B<NO_PROXY>

Specify a proxy hostname.
See L<OSSL_HTTP_parse_url(3)>.

=item B<OPENSSL_CONF>, B<OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE>

Specifies the path to a configuration file and the directory for
included files.
See L<config(5)>.

=item B<OPENSSL_ENGINES>

Specifies the directory from which dynamic engines are loaded.
See L<openssl-engine(1)>.

=item B<OPENSSL_MODULES>

Specifies the directory from which cryptographic providers are loaded.
Equivalently, the generic B<-provider-path> command-line option may be used.

=item B<OPENSSL_WIN32_UTF8>

If set, then L<UI_OpenSSL(3)> returns UTF-8 encoded strings, rather than
ones encoded in the current code page, and
the L<openssl(1)> program also transcodes the command-line parameters
from the current code page to UTF-8.
This environment variable is only checked on Microsoft Windows platforms.

=item B<OPENSSL_XXXcap>

OpenSSL supports a number of different algorithm implementations for
various machines and, by default, it determines which to use based on the
processor capabilities and run-time feature enquiry.  These environment
variables can be used to exert more control over this selection process.

The follow architecture-specific environment variables are supported:

=over 4

=item B<OPENSSL_armcap>

=item B<OPENSSL_ia32cap>

=item B<OPENSSL_ppccap>

=item B<OPENSSL_riscvcap>

=item B<OPENSSL_s390xcap>

=item B<OPENSSL_sparcv9cap>

=back

Note that B<OPENSSL_ia32cap> supports both the 32-bit and 64-bit X86
architectures.
See L<OPENSSL_ia32cap(3)>, L<OPENSSL_s390xcap(3)>.

=item B<RANDFILE>

The state file for the random number generator.
This should not be needed in normal use.
See L<RAND_load_file(3)>.

=item B<SSL_CERT_DIR>, B<SSL_CERT_FILE>

Specify the default directory or file containing CA certificates.
See L<SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3)>.
